2025/03/29 8:58:44 PM GMT+8,College of Education,ChatGpt kapag naay reporting tapos Quillbot kapag magbuhat ug reflection and all,"Mag-summarize ug content, sometimes kapag maglisod kog sabot kay ginapasimplify nako.","Sometimes, Quillbot kapag magcheck ug grammar or magparaphrase.","Yes, specifically when it comes to reporting, mas ma-elaborate nako akoa topics.","Yes, parehas anang naay mga unfamiliar na terminologies, pwede nimo sya ipa-simplify kay AI.","Yes, in a way nga kaya niya i-explain ang topics in simplest way para mas masabtan sa students.","Biggest advantage, it makes learning easier.
Drawback, naging dependent ang mga students sa AI which is not good kay di na ma enhance ang mga skills such as critical thinking skill.","Yes, over-reliance. Despite sa advantages sa pag use ug AI, we can’t deny the fact gihapon na mas naging tamad and dependent ang students."
2025/03/30 4:10:21 PM GMT+8,,"chatgpt and quillbot, I use it whenever I am having hard time in my assignments.","I use it mainly for checking grammatical errors, sometimes generate some ideas and to summarize long texts in modules",Yes specially in programming sometimes it helps me with my code.,"I think machange sya, mas napadali niya akoang mga task and mas dali sabton ang mga himuonon.","Yes like for example pag mag module lang mi or ipa self study, sometimes maglisod gyud kog sabot and gahelp jud ang ai like chatgpt kay pwede man nimo sya mapangutan-an.",Yes nakacontribute gyud sya sa akoang grade and more efficient kay naay mga task na pwede nalang nmo iautomate then mag focus ka didto sa mas lisod nga task.,Para sa akoa biggest advantages sa AI is kaya niya iautomate ang mga easy task para mas efficient pero usahay kay magsalig na ta sa AI na miski basic nalang na task di na ta kabalo muhimo.,Sa academic siguro kay over reliance lang kay naay times dili accurate ang AI and kailangan jud ug human na mucheck kung tama ba ang giingon sa AI.
2025/03/30 7:48:54 PM GMT+8,Education ,"Chatgpt, quillbot, deepseek",generating ideas,I would say a subject or task that involves math.,"Yes, AI significantly changed my approach in terms of school matter in a way that it makes my student life more bearable.","Yes. For instance, if there’s a certain task given to me and I’m having a hard time to understand the question or instruction I copy paste it to an AI tool and command it to make the question more understandable. ","I would yes YES, because AI indeed help in learning and it makes learning easier.","Biggest advantage of AI in my perspective is it significantly helped me in my study by making learning easier. But the drawbacks is I often find myself relying on AI too much, I noticed that I’m no longer putting effort in my study since AI exist.",I have none. 
2025/03/30 9:03:32 PM GMT+8,College of Education,"ChatGPT and QuillBot. I use them frequently, especially when working on assignments.","As a student in education, I use AI for research to find helpful resources quickly, for writing by generating ideas and proofreading, and for summarizing content to make studying easier. AI also helps by explaining difficult topics and gives different teaching strategies which is essential for us as a future educator.","Sometimes. I rely on AI for different strategies depending on the subject or task. For example, I use AI for research in subjects like history or education, and for writing tasks like essays or reports. I also use AI for summarizing content in complex subjects and for getting help with difficult topics.","Yes, AI has made studying more efficient by helping me find resources, summarize content, and get quick help with tough concepts. It also helps me stay organized and manage my time better.","Yes, AI tools have helped me understand difficult topics better. For example, in our major subject (teaching social studies in elementary grades), I was having trouble understanding the concept of differentiated instruction. I used AI to break down the strategy into smaller steps and provide real-world examples. This not only clarified the concept but also helped me generate creative ideas on how to teach social studies in a more engaging way. With AI’s help, I was able to plan interactive activities and tailor my lesson for different learning styles, which will make my upcoming teaching demonstration more effective and engaging.","Yes, I think AI has helped me get better grades and study more efficiently. AI makes it easier to find resources, understand difficult topics, and organize my notes which makes studying faster and more effective.","The biggest advantage of using AI for learning is that it makes studying more efficient by providing quick access to information, helping with difficult topics, and offering personalized support. It also helps organize notes and manage time better. 

However, a drawback is that relying too much on AI might reduce critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Also, AI may not always provide accurate information, so it's important to double-check sources.","Yes, personally, I have some concerns about using AI in academics. One concern is over-reliance, where there are times I depend too much on AI for answers, which could affect my ability to think critically and solve problems on my own. That's why It’s important to use AI responsibly and not replace essential learning skills.
